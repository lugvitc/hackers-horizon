# Guidelines

-   Formatting:
    -   indentation: 4 spaces
    -   use prettier if you use vscode, prettierrc file is given below
-   js:
    -   use let/const instead of var
    -   use arrow functions where possible
    -   make sure the code is readable, i.e. others should be able to read it and understand what it does
    -   use comments to tell why you have done something if needed
    -   code doing separate things should be in separate files e.g.: the code setting the timer is in `timer.js` and the code changing the navbar is in `changeNavbar.js`
-   html:
    -   use tags semantically
    -   properly indent code
    -   all styling should be done in css files, not inline
    -   edit only the sections you are working on
-   PRs:
    -   do not push directly to this repo, make a PR for any changes you want to do
