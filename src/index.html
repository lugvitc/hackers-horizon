                        In many cases, if left unmolested, alligators eventually
                        will retreat to more preferred habitats away from
                        people. However, if you encounter an animal that poses a
                        threat to human safety:
                        <br />
                        DON’T – swim outside of posted swimming areas or in
                        waters that might contain large alligators.
                        <br />
                        DO – swim with a partner within all marked swimming
                        areas. These areas are specifically situated and
                        designed to reduce potential alligator/human conflicts.
                        <br/ > DON’T – swim at night or dusk when alligators
                        most actively feed.

                        Both Prince William and Prince Harry receive a salary
                        from the British Army. Any additional costs are met by
                        The Prince of Wales or from their own private funds. If
                        either Prince were to travel by air or train to an
                        official engagement, these costs would be met from
                        public funds.

                        Yes, you can use someone else’s urine in our kit. We
                        just ask that you be 110% sure the urine is clean before
                        you use their urine. If you do use someone else’s urine
                        simply collect the sample the day of your test and
                        inject it into The Whizzinator with the refill syringe.
                        Use the sample that day.

                        No, you do not have to be fat. In fact, most of the very
                        successful sumo wrestlers, both professional and
                        amateur, are not fat, by any standard. Generally, if you
                        are athletic, you can do well in sumo. Of course, fat or
                        skinny, big or small, you are welcome to participate in
                        sumo.

                        Of course, pregnant women find belly dancing excellent
                        prenatal exercise because it strengthens the pelvic
                        muscles and loosens up the abdominal area. It
                        strengthens back and leg muscles, which are very
                        critical for a woman to carry her pregnancy well.
